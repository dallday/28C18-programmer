Tie pin 12 to the Ground
Tie Pin 24 to 5v line

The LEDs are wired in a Charlieplexing layout, using 3 330omh resistors 
The red and yellow LEDs are connected (via Resisitors) to LED1 and LED2 in opposite polarity. 
The Green LED is connected (via Resisitors) to LED2 and LED3 
So
	if LED1 is high and LED2 is low the yellow LED turns on
	if LED1 is Low and LED2 is high the Red LED turns on
	if LED2 is high as LED3 is low the Green LED turns on.
In all situation the unused pins are set to input and so high impedence.


Most of the chip pins match directly to the corresponding pins on the end of the Arduino Mega, with the exception of the Vcc ( pin 24 ) and the Ground ( pin 12 )

To build this using a strip board leave at least 3 strips above the 5v line.
cut the copper strip between the 16 rows of Arduino pins, you don't need to cut the Vcc and GND pairs ( althoughI did :)
Cut the strips between the chip socket and the Arduino pins 52 (Vcc) and 31 (GND).
Solder in the dual row of pins for the Arduino. I used extra longs pins to make soldering easier and raise it above the arduino

Insert the chip socket(I use ZIF, but a regular SIP or DIP socket will work as well) with the bottom pin one above the GND line.
Connect a wire from pin 24 of the chip socket to 5V line.
Connect a wire from pin 12 of the chip socket to GND line.

Connect a 330 ohm resistor from Arduino pin 24 to the strip just above the 5v line (line 3).
Connect a 330 ohm resistor from Arduino pin 22 to the strip just above line 3 (Line 2).
Connect a 330 ohm resistor from Arduino pin 23 to the strip just above line 2 (line 1).

Connect the red and yellow LEDS between vero board strips line 1 and and line 2.
Remember to ensure their are in different orientation.
Connect the green LED between line 2 and line 3.
as long as red and yellow are different polarities the code can always be changed if the wrong one come on :)

I added an extra pin on the bottom of the versoboard for extra stability.
